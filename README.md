## Project Description

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread, trends, and impact of the virus.  It likely involves data processing, visualization, and potentially some predictive modeling using Python and relevant libraries. The goal is to provide a clear and informative overview of the data.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Explore and clean COVID-19 related datasets.
* Visualize key trends and patterns in the spread of the virus (e.g., cases, deaths, recoveries).
* Identify factors that may have influenced the spread of COVID-19.
* Present findings in a clear and concise manner.
* Potentially, develop a model to predict future trends (if applicable).

## Tools and Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * Pandas
    * NumPy
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * [Add any other libraries used, e.g., scikit-learn, plotly, etc.]
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/felexkuria/Covid_project.git](https://github.com/felexkuria/Covid_project.git)
    cd Covid_project
    ```

2.  Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.  It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Install the dependencies (if a requirements.txt file exists)
    ```
    *Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not in the repository, you will need to install the libraries manually using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn` (and any other libraries you used).*

3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  Open the relevant notebook file (e.g., `covid_analysis.ipynb`) in your browser.

## Insights and Reflections

[In this section, you can add your personal reflections on the project. Some ideas: ]

* What were the most interesting findings from your analysis?
* What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?
* What did you learn about data analysis, visualization, or the COVID-19 pandemic itself?
* How could this project be improved or expanded in the future?  For example:
    * "One of the key challenges was dealing with missing data, which I addressed using imputation techniques."
    * "I found it particularly interesting to see the correlation between [factor A] and [factor B] in the spread of the virus."
    * "Future work could involve developing a more sophisticated predictive model or incorporating additional data sources."

**Note:** A `requirements.txt` file in your repository is very helpful for others to reproduce your environment.  If you don't have one, you can create it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` from within your virtual environment.  This file lists all the packages needed to run your code.
